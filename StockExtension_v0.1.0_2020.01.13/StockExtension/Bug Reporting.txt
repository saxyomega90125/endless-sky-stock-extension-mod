If you find a bug, reporting it will really help me out. I just don't have time to make and
test every part of this thing.

When you find one, take a screenshot if you can (snipping tool or printscreen) and give a
brief description. For example, if you are in a conversation and you see something like
'goto [whatever]' or 'accept', or you get the 'Done' button and it seems premature, send a
screenshot and tell me what was going on when it happened.
If you can't get a screenshot, you could quote a few words from the relevant area that I
can search in the data files - that's really what I'm after. Mission title, phrase from a
conversation, system name, anything that helps reduce the number of lines to search.

Also, if you want you can attach a snapshot of your save and I can probably repair it for
you if the bug caused a mission failure or anything like that.

Once you have the info, send it to this email address:
esssxtbugs@gmail.com

Doing that should take less time than it took to read this, and it will make my job of
finding and fixing the error behind your bug quick and easy.
Any help you can give is really appreciated.
